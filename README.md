# ComfyUI-MiniMax-Remover
ComfyUI-MiniMax-Remover is a custom node for ComfyUI that enables fast and efficient object removal using minimax optimization. It works in two stages: first, it trains a remover with a simplified DiT model; then it distills a robust version using CFG guidance and fewer inference steps.
